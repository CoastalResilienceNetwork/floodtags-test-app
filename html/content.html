<!--This HTML is used in the render function to build the elements within the plugin. The render function first creats a
Dijit ContentPane to hold all the elements. The ContentPane is assigned a dynamic id upon creation. The render function
takes the ContentPane id and prepends it to every element with a declared id in this HTML before the elements are created.
The unique ContentPane id makes all the element ids unique and prevents duplicate id errors in split screen mode.-->
